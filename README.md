This project focuses on improving image visibility under adverse conditions such as fog, haze, rain, snow, and underwater distortions. Utilizing a Multidomain Attention-based Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (MACGAN), the system provides robust image restoration across ground, aerial, and marine domains. MACGAN employs lightweight encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanisms to enhance critical features, outperforming traditional models in computational efficiency and restoration quality. Tested on diverse datasets, including unseen domains, it demonstrates superior adaptability and scalability for navigation and environmental imaging.
